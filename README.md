# Unity Practice Archive
 Archive of my Unity learning journey projects from the very beginning.

 ## Content

 I started diving into Unity around 2021-ish, so everything is from around that era. Projects are sorted strictly chronologically, *NOT* by quality from worst to best. Some might be embarrassing to look at, but what can we do?

 ### 1. Helix Jump
 The very first project is a simplified clone of the Helix Jump game.    
 The clone's gameplay is very similar to the original game, but some mechanics have been excluded. That's why it is called a *simplified* clone. Levels are generated randomly, user's progress is saved using PlayerPrefs.

 ### 2. Cube Surfer
 One more simplified clone of an existing game. The idea was to recreate cube stacking mechanics from the original Cube Surfer. The path spline was created using the *Dreamteck Splines* plugin from Unity Asset Store. Do not expect any path randomizations. This is just an example of mechanics.

 ### 3. Bike Rush
 This clone does not even have an actual gameplay. Roughly speaking, this is a small module with the possibility of its implementation in a larger project. Don't judge strictly, as it is just an example of the most basic AI bot behavior. But actually DO judge, this is a disaster.

 ### 4. Solar System
 Solar System is not even a full-fledged project, but rather an attempt to reming myself how Unity works. The planets are beautifully spinning, thatâ€™s all.

 ### 5. Plane Simulator
 IMHO, the nastiest kind of controllers are those designed for non-four-wheelers. So here it is - a realistic plane simulator. This is the first project that includes something more that just a gameplay mechanic. It has a shop to buy, select and paint different kinds of planes.

 ### 6. Coin Snake
 I used to be really proud of this project at a time. I still think it looks nice, just not the code-wise. The main idea is a controller for a snake made of coins, where each next coin should smoothly follow the path of the previous one. The game has a starting menu, 5 different manually-made levels with lots of obstacles and even a victory screen. Probably my favourite early-phase project.

 ### 7. Farm Runner
 This is a shot at creating an endless runner. A cute farmer (or several other characters that can be bought in the store) endlessly runs around the generated farm and pucks up apples, avoiding various obstacles and collecting 3 types of boosters. Not bad, the game even has some character animations.

 ### 8. Overcooked
 The perfect example of "execution leaves much to be desired". Despite the fact that it looks good in general, it holds together with spit, and the code is pure spaghetti. Different cooking stations allow you to cook 5 recipes, but there is no overall goal in the game. Plus to that bug upon a bug.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/vyshnovka/unity-practice-archive.git` in Git Bash.    
2. Install the appropriate versions of Unity from [archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) (almost all projects use Unity 2020.3.14, but be sure to check).    
3. Projects are located in separate folders. Open each individual folder in Unity Hub.
