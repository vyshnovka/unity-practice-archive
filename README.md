# Unity Practice Archive
 Archive of my Unity learning journey projects from the very beginning.

 ## Content

 Projects are sorted strictly chronologically, *NOT* by quality from worst to best. Some might be embarrassing to look at, but what can we do?

 ### 1. Helix Jump
 The very first project is a simplified clone of the Helix Jump game.    
 The clone's gameplay is very similar to the original game, but some mechanics have been excluded. That's why it is called a *simplified* clone. 
 Levels are generated randomly. User's progress is saved using PlayerPrefs.

 ### 2. Cube Surfer
 One more simplified clone of an existing game. The idea was to recreate cube stacking mechanics from the original Cube Surfer. The path spline was created using the *Dreamteck Splines* plugin from Unity Asset Store. Do not expect any path randomizations. This is just an example of mechanics.

 ### 3. Bike Rush
 This clone does not even have an actual gameplay. Roughly speaking, this is a small module with the possibility of its implementation in a larger project. Don't judge strictly, as this is just an example of the most basic AI bot behavior.
